Predictive Maintenance

-> Designed and implemented a predictive maintenance model to forecast equipment failure using time-series sensor data and machine learning techniques.

-> Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering (e.g., rolling statistics, vibration patterns), and labeled target events to train supervised classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).

-> Evaluated model performance using classification metrics and optimized the model for early failure detection, reducing unplanned downtime and maintenance costs.
